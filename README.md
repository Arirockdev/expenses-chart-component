## For the app I used


* HTML 

* CSS: CSS Flexbox and Grid

* JAVASCRIPT: Since I didn't have an API for this project, I used a json file, and decided to put into practice some OOP concepts.
You can see that I've used classes, class instances, methods, as well as modularized the javascript code to make it more readable.
I have to say that this is my first project where I put into practice OOP, especially in javascript.
